# sql-notebooks

Repo contains SQL specific notes for the course [database management systems](https://www.novaims.unl.pt/gibis-unidades-curriculares-optativas?d=200032) as well as on the SQL chapters from the [Database Systems Concepts book](https://www.db-book.com/db7/university-lab-dir/sample_tables-dir/index.html). Will use a microsoft SQL server and transact-SQL. Notebooks are created using Azure Data Studio and so it comes with its limitations - e.g. no latex.
